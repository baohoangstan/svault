# Welcome to Your Knowledge Base

Your personal operating system is ready.

## Quick Start

### 1. Complete Onboarding

Head to [[AGENDA]] and answer the onboarding questions. This helps me understand how to work with you.

### 2. Start Capturing

Drop anything into this **0-Inbox** folder:
- Quick thoughts
- Links to read later
- Tasks to process
- Ideas to explore

Don't worry about organization yet — just capture.

### 3. Explore Your Areas

Visit [[2-Areas]] to see the 8 life areas. Each has an index file:

- [[2-Areas/Health/0_Health_Index|Health]]
- [[2-Areas/Relationships/0_Relationships_Index|Relationships]]
- [[2-Areas/Career/0_Career_Index|Career]]
- [[2-Areas/Finance/0_Finance_Index|Finance]]
- [[2-Areas/Learning/0_Learning_Index|Learning]]
- [[2-Areas/Recreation/0_Recreation_Index|Recreation]]
- [[2-Areas/Environment/0_Environment_Index|Environment]]
- [[2-Areas/Contribution/0_Contribution_Index|Contribution]]

### 4. Use the CLI

The `./cli.sh` script gives you powerful commands:

```bash
# Sync all changes to Git
./cli.sh sync

# View tasks across the vault
./cli.sh tasks

# Read a note with backlinks
./cli.sh read "note-name"

# Check git status
./cli.sh status
```

For Obsidian integration (requires Obsidian installed):
```bash
# Create daily note
./cli.sh daily

# Search notes
./cli.sh search

# Create new note
./cli.sh create -n "Note Name"
```
